# Blink a LED💡

This project will make the LED connected to PIN 13 from the Arduino board blink on and off every second.

## Components 🎛️
- one Arduino Uno Board
- one Breadboard

- two Jumpers
- one Resistor
- one LED

## Code Explanation 💻
The **setup()** function is called once when the board is powered on or reset. <br>

It sets the **pin mode** of the LED to OUTPUT. <br>

The **loop()** function is called repeatedly after the **setup()** function. <br>

It turns the LED on, waits for a second, turns the LED off, and waits for another second.
